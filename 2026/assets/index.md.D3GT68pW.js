(Pain Points &amp; Opportunities)</strong></p><p>While 4D Flow concept is powerful, its widespread routine clinical adoption faces significant, long-standing barriers.</p><ul><li><strong>The Clinical Pain Point: Time Burden:</strong> Acquiring a comprehensive (high resolution) 4D Flow dataset typically demands <strong>30–60 minutes</strong> of scanner time. This duration is not only physically demanding for patients, often leading to motion artifacts, but also imposes prohibitive time and cost burdens on hospital workflows.</li><li><strong>The Technological Bottleneck:</strong> Insufficient Acceleration: While existing acceleration techniques (such as parallel imaging or standard compressed sensing) have reduced scan times, they commonly yield results in <strong>10–20 minutes with low to medium spatial resolution.</strong> This remains significantly longer than the <strong>sub-5-minute</strong> window desired for integration into routine clinical MRI protocols.</li><li><strong>The Unique Acceleration Potential of 4D Flow:</strong> Unlike conventional 2D or 3D MRI, 4D Flow data inherently includes three spatial dimensions plus a temporal dimension, and multiple velocity encoding dimensions. This creates a massive data acquisition burden, but simultaneously offers a vast parameter space for intelligent undersampling. The redundant information across these multiple dimensions presents a unique and significant opportunity for AI-driven reconstruction to achieve unprecedented acceleration rates.</li><li><strong>The AI Opportunity: Breaking the Speed Limit:</strong> This challenge is our call to action. We seek innovative algorithms that leverage advanced deep learning and reconstruction methodologies to bridge this critical gap. By achieving high-fidelity hemodynamic information from extreme undersampling (10x–50x data reduction), we can dramatically accelerate 4D Flow MRI.</li></ul><p><strong>The Core Goal:</strong> CMRx4DFlow2026 provides a standardized benchmark to accelerate the clinical adoption of 4D Flow MRI. We promote reconstruction algorithms that balance high-fidelity accuracy with computational efficiency, ensuring robust performance across diverse scanners and patient populations.</p><h2 id="evolution-of-the-cmrxrecon-series" tabindex="-1">Evolution of the CMRxRecon Series <a class="header-anchor" href="#evolution-of-the-cmrxrecon-series" aria-label="Permalink to “Evolution of the CMRxRecon Series”">​</a></h2><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>CMRxRecon Series</th><th>Modalities</th><th>No. of Centers</th><th>No. of Scanners</th><th>Populations</th><th>Sampling Trajectory</th><th>No. of Subjects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2023</td><td>Cine, Mapping</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Healthy individuals</td><td>2D Uniform</td><td>~300</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>Cine, T1 and T2 Mapping, Blackblood, Phase contrast, Tagging</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Healthy individuals</td><td>2D Uniform, 3D k-t Uniform, 3D k-t Gaussian, 3D k-t Radial</td><td>~300</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>Cine, T1, T2 and T2* Mapping, T1w, T2w, T1rho, Blackblood, Phase contrast, LGE, Perfusion</td><td>5+</td><td>10+</td><td>Healthy individuals and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; dilated cardiomyopathy; myocardial infarction; coronary artery disease; arrhythmias, etc.</td><td>2D and 3D k-t Uniform, 2D and 3D k-t Gaussian, 2D and 3D k-t Radial</td><td>~600</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>4D Flow MRI</td><td>10+</td><td>10+</td><td>Healthy individuals; patients with multi-organ diseases (heart, brain, aorta, kidney, liver, carotid artery)</td><td>3D Cartesian (k-t Gaussian)</td><td>~400</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To bridge the gap between research and clinical deployment, the 2026 challenge utilizes over <strong>400 cases</strong> from <strong>10+</strong> centers to evaluate reconstruction performance across four specific dimensions:</p><ol><li><strong>Regular Task 1: Accurate Reconstruction under High Acceleration</strong> – To evaluate the robustness and generalization performance of reconstruction models under high (10x-50x) acceleration factors across different clinical centers and various scanners.</li><li><strong>Regular Task 2: Fast Reconstruction under Limited Computing Resources</strong> – To evaluate the clinical performance and computational efficiency of reconstruction models across standardized hardware (NVIDIA A6000).</li><li><strong>Special Task 1: Generalizability across new sites and diseases</strong> – To evaluate the hardware robustness and cross-site generalization performance of reconstruction models across different magnetic field strengths (1.5T, 3T, and 5T) and diverse clinical scenarios.</li><li><strong>Special Task 2: Generalizability across different anatomical regions</strong> – To evaluate the universality and cross-organ generalization performance of reconstruction models across multiple anatomical regions (e.g., brain, liver, kidney, and carotid arteries).</li></ol><h2 id="awards" tabindex="-1">Awards <a class="header-anchor" href="#awards" aria-label="Permalink to “Awards”">​</a></h2><p>The top 5 winners in each task will receive monetary awards.
