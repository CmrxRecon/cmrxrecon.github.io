International Conference On Medical Image Computing &amp; Computer Assisted Intervention)</p><p>🫀 CMRxRecon2026: Ultra-Fast 4D Flow MRI — Redefining the Future of Cardiovascular Imaging</p><blockquote><p>Our Vision: To challenge physical limits and leverage AI to dramatically accelerate complex 4D flow MRI acquisitions and reconstructions, transforming prolonged procedures into clinically viable rapid scans, and thereby ensuring every cardiovascular patient can benefit from advanced flow visualization.</p></blockquote><p>🌟 What is 4D Flow MRI? (Beyond Images: A &quot;Digital Twin&quot; of Your Cardiovascular System)</p><p>Imagine not just taking a static &quot;snapshot&quot; of the heart, but creating a complete, dynamic replica of blood circulating within you in the digital world. This is 4D Flow MRI—building a precise cardiovascular &quot;Digital Twin.&quot;</p><ul><li>3D Space + 1D Time: 4D Flow MRI captures the intricate hemodynamic dynamics across the entire cardiac cycle, detailing every pulsation, swirl, and impact of blood flow in three-dimensional space.</li><li>Beyond Anatomy: It quantitatively calculates critical hemodynamic parameters such as Flow Velocity, Wall Shear Stress (WSS), and Vorticity.</li><li>Pivotal Clinical Value: Clinicians can use this &quot;digital proxy&quot; to precisely assess risks for aortic aneurysms, stenosis, or dissections, and simulate surgical planning.</li></ul><p>🎯 Why This Challenge? (Pain Points &amp; Opportunities)</p><p>While 4D Flow concept is powerful, its widespread routine clinical adoption faces significant, long-standing barriers.</p><ul><li>The Clinical Pain Point: Time Burden: Acquiring a comprehensive 4D Flow dataset typically demands 30–60 minutes of scanner time. This duration is not only physically demanding for patients, often leading to motion artifacts, but also imposes prohibitive time and cost burdens on hospital workflows.</li><li>The Technological Bottleneck: Insufficient Acceleration: While existing acceleration techniques (such as parallel imaging or standard compressed sensing) have reduced scan times, they commonly yield results in 10–20 minutes. This remains significantly longer than the sub-5-minute window desired for integration into routine clinical MRI protocols.</li><li>The Unique Acceleration Potential of 4D Flow: Unlike conventional 2D or 3D MRI, 4D Flow data inherently includes three spatial dimensions plus a temporal dimension, and multiple velocity encoding dimensions. This creates a massive data acquisition burden, but simultaneously offers a vast parameter space for intelligent undersampling. The redundant information across these multiple dimensions presents a unique and significant opportunity for AI-driven reconstruction to achieve unprecedented acceleration rates.</li><li>The AI Opportunity: Breaking the Speed Limit: This challenge is our call to action. We seek innovative algorithms that leverage advanced deep learning and reconstruction methodologies to bridge this critical gap. By achieving high-fidelity hemodynamic information from extreme undersampling (10x–50x data reduction), we can dramatically accelerate 4D Flow MRI.</li></ul><p>The Core Goal: To transform 4D Flow MRI from a specialized research tool into a widely accessible, routine clinical diagnostic technology, thereby bringing the cardiovascular &quot;Digital Twin&quot; to every patient.</p><hr><h2 id="evolution-of-the-cmrxrecon-series" tabindex="-1">Evolution of the CMRxRecon Series <a class="header-anchor" href="#evolution-of-the-cmrxrecon-series" aria-label="Permalink to “Evolution of the CMRxRecon Series”">​</a></h2><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>CMRxRecon Series</th><th>Modalities</th><th>No. of Centers</th><th>No. of Scanners</th><th>Populations</th><th>Sampling Tratectory</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2023</td><td>Cine, Mapping</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Healthy</td><td>2D Uniform</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>Cine, T1 and T2 Mapping, Blackblood, Phase contrast, Tagging.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Healthy</td><td>2D Uniform, 3D k-t Uniform, 3D k-t Gaussian，3D k-t Radial</td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>Cine, T1, T2 and T2* Mapping, T1w, T2w, T1rho, Blackblood, Phase contrast, LGE, Perfusion.</td><td>5+</td><td>10+</td><td>Hearthy individuals and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; dilated cardiomyopathy; myocardial infarction.; coronary artery disease; arrhythmias, etc.</td><td>2D and 3D k-t Uniform, 2D and 3D k-t Gaussian，2D and 3D k-t Radial</td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>4D Flow MRI</td><td>5+</td><td>4+</td><td>Patients with aortic pathologies (stenosis, regurgitation, aneurysm, dissection, coarctation)</td><td>3D Cartesian (Gaussian)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>CMRxRecon2026 aims to bridge these gaps by advancing ultra-fast 4D flow MRI reconstruction.
