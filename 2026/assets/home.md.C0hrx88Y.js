The previous CMRxRecon2023 and CMRxRecon2024 dataset did not cover multi-center, multi-vendor, and multiple diseases. Therefore, this year we aim to make an important leap towards real-world clinical scenarios.</p><h2 id="background" tabindex="-1">Background <a class="header-anchor" href="#background" aria-label="Permalink to “Background”">​</a></h2><p>Cardiac MRI (CMR) has become an essential tool for diagnosing and evaluating cardiovascular diseases, offering multi-parametric, high-resolution anatomical and functional data. CMR reconstruction from highly under-sampled k-space data has gained significant attention in recent research. Numerous AI-based image reconstruction algorithms have shown potential in improving imaging performance and patient experience in recovering high-quality images from aggressively undersampled k-space measurements. However, the complexity and diversity of CMR scans in real-world applications, involving various image contrasts, sampling trajectories, equipment vendors, anatomical structures, and disease types, present a great challenge for existing AI-based reconstruction methods, which are usually developed for only one or a few specific scanning settings. In practice, there are often inevitable distribution mismatches between the training data and target data, due to the diversities listed above. Therefore, building and validating universal and robust reconstruction models for handling these diversities remain to be critical technical challenges for multi-parametric CMR imaging.</p>',8)])])}const g=a(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
